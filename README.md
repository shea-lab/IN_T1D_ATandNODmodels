# All data and code herein are used for the gene expression analysis presented in the paper "Polymer scaffolds delineate healthy from diseased states at sites distal from the pancreas in two models of Type 1 Diabetes."
# Run the "30Aug2022-RRU_RNAseq_Functions_for_all_analyses.R" code prior to any others in order to initialize the functions need for the analysis.
# If running the overlapping pathways section in "NODseqanalyses.R" the GSEA section in "ATanalyses.R" must be run first.
